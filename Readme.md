#  Agricultural Optimization Engine

# 1 GENERAL INFORMATION

## 1.1 Purpose
Build a Predictive Mode so as to suggest the most suitable crops to grow based on 
the available Climate and Soil conditions.

## 1.2 Scope
Achieve precision Farming by Optimizing the Agricultural Production.

## 1.3 Project Overview
- We have to Optimize productivity.
- By understanding requirements of Climate and Soil Conditions for Crops
- Helps us to cope up with weather unpredictably 

# 2 CURRENT SYSTEM SUMMARY
In these days ,due to many conditions , Farmers can not grow their fields and 
crops . So we make an engine which predict best ph of soil, rainfall,humidity ,etc. Our prediction Engine will assure the Farmers to make their growth increase.

# 3 Functional Requirement
## Following are the functional requirement:
- Data cleaning
- Data Handling
- Features detection from data
- Machine Learning algorithm

## 3.1 EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE
- Python (including libraries like Pandas, matplotlib etc.)
- Jupyter notebook

# 4 Data source
In this project I will use the DataSet that is given on Kaggle.

The dataset link is given below:
